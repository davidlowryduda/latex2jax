latex2jax
=========

We have latex2wp and [mse2wp](http://github.com/davidlowryduda/mse2wp), but
Wordpress is restrictive.

This is the first tool towards a more independent, freer site. There are a few
fundamental assumptions:

    1. You have an AMS-LaTeX file, and you want it displayed on a website
    2. The site uses Mathjax
    3. You want to be able to manipulate things like Theorem environments with css

This is the very beginning, and very much in development.

Implementation
--------------

This is implemented in python, similar to mse2wp.
